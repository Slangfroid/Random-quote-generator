# Overview
This is a Random Quote generator that I was able to complete in around 20 hours.

The goal of making this generator was to learn how to code in html, css, javascript with the hopes of becomming
proficient in all three of the languages. I love learning and this project was a lot of fun to make.

The harmony that the three languages have is fun to work with. Being able to make a button that was clickable and
worked to generate quotes was a really satisfying accomplishment.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item One: Css styling to make the source and the quote in the same box
